# GeLo BatteryReporting SampleApp NoSDK iOS

This sample iOS shows how to range Gelo battery life reporting beacons using nothing but Apple's [CoreBluetooth framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html).

If you want to leverage the [Gelo platform](https://platform.gelosite.com/users/sign_in) for text, audio, video content, analytics, and beacon management, then you'll want to use the [GeLoSDK for iOS](https://github.com/GeLoInc/GeLoSDK-iOS).
